trying geospatial data

fulium package:
The folium maps do not seem to render on GitHub natively. The github link to the .ipynb file can be dropped into nbviewer.org and get a full dynamic output, when provided a valid folium.Map instance. 
Two datasets:
- nashville data
- census tract data - VA2019
